How do your pages reference Javascript Libs?
- directly rendered in page: typically page specific .js files
- via \Shared\_Layout.cs : typically all general js libraries for the application

How do I get them?
- javascrip nuget package manager?  I forgot but I used visual studio to help with javascript packages

How do I integrate them in to VS?
_references.js file integrates intellisense for Javascript.
At the root of the Scripts folder lists all of the libraries and keeps them in sync...per the doc.
